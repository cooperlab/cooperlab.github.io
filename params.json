We are focused on the development of image analysis and machine learning algorithms to extract information from cancer images, and to use this information to gain scientific insights and to improve the classification of cancers for better prognostics. Our site, the [Cancer Digital Slide Archive](http://cancer.digitalslidearchive.net/) currently hosts more than 20TB of whole slide images of cancer associated with [The Cancer Genome Atlas](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) project. You can read more about this resource in our [interview](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/researchhighlights/tcgainaction/CancerDigitalSlideArchive) with the National Cancer Institute.\r\n\r\nPlease check our publications [publications](http://cooperlab.net/publications.html) page for examples on how we apply these tools with our collaborators, including our recent review paper in [Laboratory Investigation](http://www.nature.com/labinvest/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/labinvest2014153a.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Google Summer of Code 2015\r\nDr. Cooper and Michael Nalisnik are serving as mentors for Google Summer of Code 2015. Please see the [ideas page](https://docs.imphub.org/display/PS/Google+Summer+of+Code+-+2015) and our project FAQs for [active learning](http://cooperlab.net/GSOC_fast.html) and [convolutional networks](http://cooperlab.net/GSOC_deep.html) for more information. \r\n\r\n### [Active Learning](https://github.com/cooperlab/ActiveLearning)\r\nWe are [developing](https://github.com/cooperlab/ActiveLearning) a web-based machine-learning system that enables biomedical researchers to train machine learning algorithms interactively on massive imaging datasets. This system uses _active learning_ to provide a natural interaction between experts and learning algorithms with minimal knob tweaking, and very limited data labeling requirements. In this framework, the learning algorithms drive the selection of examples for human labeling, achieving better accuracy with less human effort. This work is funded by the [National Library of Medicine](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact us Lee Cooper (@cooperlab) for more information.","google":"UA-60842597-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
